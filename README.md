A simple, professional, and modern template for building and maintaining TypeScript libraries. This template integrates the best tools, workflows, and practices to help you focus on developing your library without worrying about setup.

## üöÄ Features

- **TypeScript First**: Full support for modern TypeScript features with strict typing.
- **Effortless Build**: Uses [Tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev) for fast and simple builds. Supports both ESM and CommonJS.
- **Code Quality**: Preconfigured [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io)ensure a clean, maintainable codebase.
- **Testing Ready**: Includes [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) for fast, reliable unit testing.
- **Conventional Commits**: Enforces commit message standards with [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) and [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).
- **Documentation**: Powered by [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev) for easy and interactive documentation.
- **Automated Releases**: Handles versioning and changelogs with [Release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it).
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Configured with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for linting, testing, publishing, and deploying docs.
- **Dependabot Integration**: Keeps your dependencies updated automatically.

## üîÑ Development Workflow

This template is set up with a single branch workflow. This means that you will make changes directly in the `main` branch. This approach is suitable for small projects and solo developers. Here is the workflow:

1. Make changes directly in the `main` branch.
1. Use [conventional commit messages](https://gist.github.com/fvena/89e706aaf74705a83c7c39a171da466c).
1. Push changes to trigger the CI pipeline for linting and testing.

## Releasing a Version

1. Run the release script locally to bump the version and generate a changelog. The release script will:

   - Update the version based on the commit messages.
   - Generate a changelog.
   - Create a new git tag.
   - Push changes and tags to the repository.

   ```bash
   npm run release
   ```

1. The CI/CD pipeline will publish the new version to NPM and deploy updated documentation to Github Pages.

## üìñ Documentation

This template includes a preconfigured docs folder powered by Vitepress. To start writing documentation:

1. Edit or add markdown files in the docs folder.
2. Start a local preview with:

   ```bash
   npm run docs:dev
   ```
